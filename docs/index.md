# Python DMI Open Data SDKs

This project provides a collection of Python SDKs (Software Development Kits) designed to simplify interaction with the various open data APIs offered by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).

Each subdirectory within these docs corresponds to a specific DMI API, such as `climatedata`, `forecastdata`, etc., and contains detailed documentation for its respective SDK, including available API endpoints and data models.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to offer Python developers an easy-to-use, consistent interface for accessing DMI's rich datasets, enabling integration into a wide range of applications, research projects, and data analysis workflows.
